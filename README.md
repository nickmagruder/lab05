### Assignment Instructions:

### Feature #1: Deployment
Following the deployment checklist found in the README for Today, and using the starter code found in the starter-code folder of this lab, complete a full deployment of your portfolio lab to heroku.

*You will need to initiate a new repository to complete this task.
*Add the URL to your live, deployed server to your README.

### Feature #2:
Add an event listener to each animal  such that when you click, a sound plays (might I suggest barking or bleating or meowing)

### Feature #3:
On the same event listen, trigger a Modal to pop up with the description of the animal you clicked on.

### Stretch Goal: 
Trigger more than one sound file to play (randomly selected, a different one per animal, one for even horned animals, one for odd, whatever you like)

### Submission Instructions
Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab on a branch.
Create a PR back to the master branch of your repository, and merge it cleanly.

Deploy again, so your latest code is published live via Heroku.

On Canvas, submit a link to your PR. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:

* A link to the deployed version of your latest code.
* A question within the context of today’s lab assignment
* An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment
